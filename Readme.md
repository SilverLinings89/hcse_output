# Hallmarks of Cancer Search Engine

This repository is an auxiliary repository for the three main repos of the project: 
- [The parser repository]()
- [The analyzer repository]()
- [The website repository]()

This repo stores the output generated by the *analyzer* project and can be used in the website project. A similar repo doesn't exist for the first step's output because that steps generates a very large dataset. 

Two files are included in this project:
- The article_database.json file contains pairs consisting of article pubmed Ids and their associated rating.
- The rating database contains 2 things:
    - An ordered list of the hallmarks and their descriptions and
    - pairs of keywords with their associated rating.

Both of these files are required by the website as static resources as all the data it needs to perform searches, rate text and show visualizations.
